Title: The ANMU Explosion Theory by Anas - Deep Space Thoughts


---

Introduction:

The ANMU Explosion Theory, developed by Anas, delves into the origins of the universe in a way that redefines cosmic beginnings. Unlike traditional cosmological theories that start with the Big Bang, the ANMU Explosion Theory introduces an earlier phase, where light, emanating from a godly, supreme source, creates the universe through a process of intense containment, reflection, and subsequent explosion.

The ANMU Theory, short for Anirb’s New Model of the Universe, envisions light as the primal force behind creation, with an initial circular boundary containing and intensifying it until it forces the universe into existence.

The ANMU Explosion Theory Explained:

1. The Circle of Creation

Before the birth of the universe as we know it, there was a singular, closed circle. This boundary was the only structure in existence, a perfect, unbroken line that encased a unique energy source—light. According to ANMU, this light originated from a godly, supreme source, beyond human comprehension. This source radiated light endlessly into the circle.

However, this light could not escape the circular boundary due to a phenomenon akin to total internal reflection. Bound by the laws of this primordial circle, each light ray was trapped within, reflecting back with each attempt to exit. The continuous addition of light created a buildup of energy and, with it, an increase in frequency and intensity.

2. Light as the Basic Building Block

In the ANMU model, light is the universe’s fundamental component, setting it apart from theories that emphasize mass or particles. Here, light itself represents the first substance from which everything emerges. Light rays, with varying thickness and intensity, entered the circle with immense speed, forming layers upon layers of reflected waves. Each new wave added energy to the existing light, creating denser and denser packets of energy and frequency.

This growing accumulation of light rays, with their perpetual movement, began to push against the boundaries of the circle. As the density of light reached critical levels, the containment of such energy became unsustainable. This phase can be thought of as the "Light Confinement Epoch."

3. The Explosive Expansion: Light to Matter

Eventually, the confined light’s energy, frequency, and density reached a point of critical mass. This energy buildup led to a series of massive internal explosions within the circle, resulting in its expansion. With each explosion, the circle grew larger, allowing the light to escape its purely confined state and interact with new dimensions, creating matter in the form of dense gases.

As this expansion continued, the gases began to cool and condense, forming regions of higher density that would become the seeds of stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures.

4. The Second Explosion - The Big Bang

After the circle’s expansion and the formation of dense gases, a final explosion—akin to what we traditionally call the Big Bang—occurred. This explosion scattered the dense gases outward, spreading them across the newly forming space, giving birth to the observable universe. It is this second, climactic explosion that initiates time, space, and the traditional laws of physics as we know them.

Thus, according to the ANMU Explosion Theory, the Big Bang was not the beginning of creation but rather the culmination of an earlier phase of intense light confinement, buildup, and expansion.

The ANMU Formula for Light Confinement and Explosion

To quantify the theory, we propose the following formula for understanding the relationship between light, energy buildup, and expansion within the ANMU framework.

Let:

 = Intensity of incoming light from the supreme source

 = Frequency generated within the confined space due to internal reflections

 = Total energy buildup within the circle

 = Radius of the circular boundary


As light continuously reflects within the circle and adds to the energy, we can relate the buildup of energy with frequency and radius through:

E = L \times f \times R^2

where:

1.  (Intensity) represents the continuous input of godly light.


2.  (Frequency) increases with the confinement and superimposition of light waves.


3.  accounts for the circular area in which the light is contained, influencing the space available for energy accumulation.



As  increases through the initial explosions,  approaches a critical threshold, leading to expansion. When this threshold is surpassed, the contained energy leads to the explosive formation of dense gases and, ultimately, the Big Bang.

Conclusion

The ANMU Explosion Theory offers a unique perspective on the universe’s origin, placing light at the center of cosmic creation. Through an initial phase of light confinement, buildup, and eventual release, this theory provides a new way of looking at the relationship between light and matter. Rather than starting with the Big Bang, the universe in this model unfolds from an even earlier sequence, adding depth to our understanding of how the cosmos began.

In the ANMU framework, the universe is an ongoing process, rooted in a timeless source of light. The journey from containment to expansion reveals a cycle that may continue beyond our observable reality, offering a profound, godly mystery at the heart of existence.
