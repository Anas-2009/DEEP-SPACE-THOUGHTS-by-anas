Theory Overview

The ANMU Explosion Theory proposes a unique view on the origins of the universe, exploring what might have happened before the Big Bang. According to this theory, a "Circle Light Explosion" (or CL Explosion) preceded the Big Bang. This explosion was not random but was driven by specific conditions within a pre-existing circle of light and energy from a supreme source. The theory suggests that light, energy, and frequency were the fundamental elements in the early universe.

The Pre-Universe: Circle of Light

Before the creation of the universe, there existed a perfect Circle of Light that contained energy from a supreme source—godly and beyond our understanding. This light, confined within the circle, obeyed the principles of Total Internal Reflection. Thus, it could not escape and continuously reflected within the circle.

This led to a build-up of energy due to several factors:

High Frequency of Light: Light rays were arriving continuously, each with energy and frequency, amplifying the energy in the circle.

Density of Light Rays: Light rays were packed into the limited space within the circle, leading to collisions and energy amplification.


This phenomenon can be explained using a few derived equations and formulas.

Energy and Frequency in the Circle

1. Energy Amplification Formula
The energy  inside the circle grows as more light enters. Given the reflection and accumulation, we can express the amplification as:



E=Eo.e<¶ft>

where:

Eo is the initial energy level.

¶ represents the density of light rays.

f is the frequency of the light from the supreme source.

t is time.


This exponential formula suggests that as light continued to reflect and collide within the circle, the energy grew rapidly.

2. Frequency Buildup
Since frequency is directly related to energy (E=hf, where h is Planck's constant), the constant influx of light increased the total frequency within the circle. Over time, this buildup became unsustainable, creating intense pressure.

Circle Light Explosion (CL Explosion)

Eventually, the energy and pressure reached a critical point, causing the Circle Light Explosion (CL Explosion). This explosion represents a transformative moment in the theory:

Expansion of the Circle: The explosion caused the circle to expand outward, releasing the dense, confined light and forming dense gases and new particles from the released energy.

Formation of Dense Gases: These gases became the building blocks of matter in the universe, setting the stage for the Big Bang.


This explosive transformation can be visualized as an energy burst:
E=k.E

where k is a proportionality constant indicating the amount of energy released during the explosion.

Transition to the Big Bang

After the CL Explosion, the universe was filled with dense gases and particles that had formed from the previous explosion. This gaseous state eventually underwent another massive event—the Big Bang—which further expanded and cooled, leading to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets.

In summary:

1. Circle Light Explosion (CL Explosion): Generated dense gases and matter.


2. Big Bang: Applied to these gases, triggering the universe's creation as we understand it.
